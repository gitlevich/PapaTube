# Prompt–Response Correlation (up to 2025-06-23 10:00)

## Premise

The user issues very precise, domain-language prompts describing desired
behaviour (“pp button”, “Controls overlay”, “Player”, etc.).  The closer my
answers follow that vocabulary, the higher the implementation success.

## Observations

1. **High-clarity prompts → success in ≤2 iterations**  
   • Example: *“Scrub bar must fade with buttons.”* – One code change adjusted
     the `.opacity` modifier; behaviour matched spec immediately.

2. **Ambiguous or inferred prompts → regression loops**  
   • Early FSM removal: I assumed callbacks were unnecessary; resulted in
     overlapping loads and desync.  Lack of explicit rule about serialising
     loads caused repeated fixes.

3. **Introducing glossary stabilised conversation**  
   After we wrote `terminology.md` your prompts referenced “Controls overlay”
   and “Startup snapshot”.  My changes mapped 1-to-1, reducing mis-fires.

4. **Spec updates drive code refactor**  
   Each new rule (R-5 grid interaction, R-4 full overlay fade) led to code
   edits directly in the referenced component, no architectural churn.

## Metrics (subjective)

| Phase | Avg. iterations per feature | Mis-understandings |
|-------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Pre-glossary | 3-4 | Frequent (FSM issue, dim overlay) |
| Post-glossary | 1-2 | Minor (overlay touch pass-through) |

## Prompt style comparison

| Prompt excerpt | Type | Result |
|----------------|------|--------|
| *“bug: youtube playlist entered in settings is not loading. what appears in the text field after i pasted a link is only a fragment of url. is the app validating that url?”* | **Diagnostic-push** (user reports breakage but not desired outcome) | Took several guesses; required back-and-forth to discover missing OAuth scope. |
| *“When a video ends, I expect: grid visible, controls hidden, tiles clickable.”* | **Vision-led** (explicit scenario) | Implemented in one edit by toggling `isEnded` and disabling overlays. |
| *“make scrub bar fade too.”* | Mixed; single declarative constraint | One-line opacity move fixed on first try. |
| *“video bar flashes when i press play”* (without spec) | Diagnostic-push | Required two iterations (0.7 s overlay delay, then overlay removal on ended). |

Patterns:
1. Diagnostic-push prompts (“it's broken, fix") often lack acceptance criteria → higher iteration count.
2. Vision-led prompts enumerate state, action, expected outcome → immediate mapping to code edits.
3. Adding domain vocabulary inside prompts (“Controls overlay", "Idle-fade") dramatically increases hit-rate because they align with code structure.

## Updated conclusion
Clear, constraint-rich prompts that use our shared glossary routinely yield correct behaviour in a single iteration; terse "it's broken" reports tend to spawn exploratory fixes.  Continuing to evolve specs/glossary—and framing requests as state-transition expectations—minimises churn.
