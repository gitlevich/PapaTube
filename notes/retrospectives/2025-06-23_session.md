# Retrospective – 2025-06-23

## Keep (worked well)
* Model the domain explicitly so code & tests share the Ubiquitous Language (e.g. the new `Playlist`).
* Unit-tests must target production code only; stubs are acceptable only as temporary scaffolding slated for removal.
* Add new source files through Xcode (or automated tooling) rather than hand-editing the `.pbxproj`.

## Drop (didn't work)
* Manually patching `project.pbxproj` IDs – error-prone and corrupted the project.
* Writing tests against throw-away stubs; they create false confidence and cleanup work.

## Try next (experiment)
* Integrate a command-line project tool (`xcodeproj`, `tuist`, or similar) to add files and configure targets safely, making the workflow fully scriptable and avoiding PBX corruption.
